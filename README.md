# PIPELINE PROCESSOR DESIGN

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: JANANI G

INTERN ID: CT08NTH

DOMAIN: VLSI

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

OVERVIEW:

This project involves designing a 4-stage pipelined processor capable of executing basic instructions efficiently. The processor architecture follows a pipelined approach to improve instruction throughput and performance.

SUPPORTED INSTRUCTIONS:

ADD – Performs addition of two operands.
SUB – Performs subtraction of two operands.
LOAD – Loads data from memory into a register.
PIPELINE STAGES
FETCH (IF) – Retrieves the instruction from memory.
DECODE (ID) – Decodes the instruction and fetches operands.
EXECUTE (EX) – Performs arithmetic/logic operations.
WRITE-BACK (WB) – Stores the result back into a register or memory.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Develop a 4-stage pipelined processor using Verilog/VHDL.
Implement data forwarding and hazard detection if required.
Simulate and verify each pipeline stage.

DELIVERABLES:
✔ Processor Design in Verilog/VHDL
✔ Testbench for Functional Verification
✔ Simulation Demonstrating Pipeline Execution

INSTRUCTIONS:

Clone this repository.
Implement the pipelined processor in Verilog/VHDL.
Compile and simulate the design using an HDL simulator (ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, etc.).
Run the testbench and analyze simulation results.
